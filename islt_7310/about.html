		My name is Emily Lempka and I am in my final semester of my Masters of Library and Information Science program. My coursework has 
        included reference services, cataloging, management, archival practice, digital media, and metadata. I am excited to see what the 
        future holds after graduation, and can’t wait to begin my career. I have experience digitizing a variety of media formats including 
        tapes, film negatives, paintings, slides, and paper documents. I am looking forward to beginning an upcoming digitization project at 
        my current job, where I work as an administrative assistant. The experience I have enjoyed most is working with metadata and digital 
        media, which I believe will be helpful in a web development context. I have a few years of coding experience, but have never really 
        done much with HTML. In my free time I like to bake, read, and go on walks. I am also an avid board game player, and am currently 
        participating in a challenge to play one hundred games this year. <br>
