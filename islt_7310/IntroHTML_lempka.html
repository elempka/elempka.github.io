    My name is Emily Lempka and I am in my final semester of my Masters of Library and Information Science program.  My coursework has included reference services, cataloging, management, archival practice, digital media, and metadata.  I am excited to see what the future holds after graduation, and can’t wait to begin my career.  I have experience digitizing a variety of media formats including tapes, film negatives, paintings, slides, and paper documents.  I am looking forward to beginning an upcoming digitization project at my current job, where I work as an administrative assistant.  The experience I have enjoyed most is working with metadata and digital media, which I believe will be helpful in a web development context.  I have a few years' of coding experience, but have never really done much with HTML.  
In my free time I like to bake, read, and go on walks.  I am also an avid board game player, and am currently participating in a challenge to play one hundred games this year.
