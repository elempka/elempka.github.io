            <p class="content"> I tried out a lot of different interests and majors before finding library science for graduate school, and I am pleased that I finally have found the career path for me.  I have really enjoyed how library science combines what I love about the humanities and stem.  It is a fun challenge balancing the technical aspects and the person-to-person aspects. </p>
            <p>While studying library science, I have found a particular interest in archives.  I am most interested in digital archives and digital preservation.  So much of what we all interact with on a day to day basis is digital, and it is easy to overlook that content in-terms of preservation, given how easy it is to access.  I also have loved learning and working with metadata throughout my coursework, it has easily been my favorite topic Iâ€™ve learned about.  I love the idea of making content searchable and accessible through metadata. </p>
            <p>Currently I am working as an administrative assistant in Washington, D.C.  I am hoping over the next few months to involve myself more with archival work at my current job.  There are decades worth of documents, pictures, and videos that I would like to help digitize, catalog, and create metadata for.  I am also looking for ways to get involved as a volunteer with local museums or historical societies in my area.  Overall, I am looking forward to graduation and turning my focus to archives.</p>
